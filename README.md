## Material Properties – Regression Analysis
This work centers on exploring and modelling datasets of material properties through regression techniques. The goal is to examine how different chemical and physical characteristics interact, prepare and visualise the data effectively, and develop predictive models in Python.

## Summary

Using a dataset that includes periodic table attributes, melting temperatures, band gaps, and other elemental metrics, the following steps were carried out:

- Removed extreme outliers via threshold-based filtering.
- Illustrated feature distributions using box-and-whisker plots.
- Measured inter-feature relationships with Pearson correlation heatmaps.
- Removed highly correlated variables to reduce redundancy.
- Built a linear regression model to forecast the gllbsc_gap variable.
- Assessed performance by plotting predicted values against actual measurements.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub
  
## Key Takeaway
This project showcases a complete regression modelling process for materials data — from preprocessing and visual exploration to model building and validation.
